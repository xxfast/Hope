This was our 1st place winning project from Oracle's Thinkquest in 2011. In their words
> This game helps players to not only develop analytical and problem-solving skills, but also to develop hope. The object of this game is to rebuild a village after a war. Players must earn enough money through farming and mining to repair damaged public facilities. To be successful, they must complete five reconstruction missions and several heart-warming mini-games along the way. 

Thinkquest was a international competition organised by Oracle Education Foundation, a non-profit org under Oracle. It was decomissioned to oblivion in 2013, but thinkquest.org can be found in the [archives](https://wayback.archive-it.org/3635/20130919154602/http://www.thinkquest.org/library/winners/2011_application_development.html), where you can see this game listed as winners under *Application Development - 19 and Under*

## Why open-source this now?

Well, flash is dead in about 9 months. So its better to get this baby out before never.
